### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a big fan of code being able to be run more than once (aka. reproducibility) because inefficiency hurts my head. I'm convinced that one of the major factors of getting to the illusive "reproducibility" is tailoring the code to suit the end user and make it as easy as possible to access. This leads nicely into the importance of good documentation and Marie Kondo level tidiness...

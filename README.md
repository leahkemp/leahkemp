### Hello!

I'm a human (as far as I know, and as far as you know...). I like data and dancing. They haven't yet occured simultaneously, but there is time yet ðŸ’…

I'm a big fan of code being able to be run more than once (aka. reproducibility) because inefficiency hurts my head. I'm convinced that, after containers and workflow languages, one of the major factors of getting to the illusive "reproducibility" is tailoring the code to suit the end user and make it as easy as possible to access. This leads nicely into the importance of good documentation and Marie Kondo level tidiness...

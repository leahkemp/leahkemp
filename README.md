### Hello!

I'm a human (as far as I know, and as far as you know...). I like data and dancing. They haven't yet occurred simultaneously, but there is time yet ðŸ’…

The longer I code, the fewer strong opinions I have on what code should look like. But I do like good documentation and simplicity. I also think it can often be wise to be a lazy programmer. For example, producing code when there is a good reason to.
